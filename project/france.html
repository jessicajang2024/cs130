          <p>Its tourist attractions illustrate the history of the human race,  from the prehistoric sites of Cro Magnon to the steel and glass of the Futuroscope; they include fine vestiges of all European civilisations, from the prehistoric megaliths of Carnac and the Roman remains of Provence, through medieval castles and cathedrals, to the splendours of Versailles, the nineteenth century Eiffel Tower, or the resolute modernity of the TGV.</p>

          <p>In addition, France has the necessary tourism infrastructure to cope with its status as leading tourist destination - more hotels and campsites than any other country of Europe, probably more gites or holiday cottages, the best and most modern rail network in Europe, and a fine system of motorways linking all main towns and cities.   </p>

            <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>There is no more famous landmark in the world than the Eiffel Tower. It announces to all who see it: This is Paris. Not only does it dominate the skyline of Paris, but it is also a landmark of building construction history. </p>
            <p class="margin-top-10"> 
        <p>When the French government was organizing the Centennial Exposition of 1889, a fair to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, the noted bridge engineer Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel was asked to design and build a structure to symbolize the occasion. His finished product aroused both praise and criticism and a good deal of amazement.</p>
        <p>Nothing like it had ever been built. It is a 984-foot (300-meter) tower of open-lattice wrought iron. Not until the Chrysler Building was completed in New York City in 1930 was there a taller structure in the world. The base of the tower consists of four semicircular arches, inspired by both artistic design and weight-bearing engineering considerations. Glass-walled elevators, designed by the Otis Elevator Company, ascend on a curve up the legs of the tower to the first and second platforms. Two new pairs of counterbalanced elevators go from the second level to the third platform near the top. From this platform the view extends for 50 miles (80 kilometers) on a clear day.</p>
        <p>After the 1889 fair closed, Eiffel realized that the only way to save his monument would be to find new and profitable uses for it. He supervised changes to accommodate a meteorological station in 1890, a military telegraph station in 1903, and a laboratory for studying aerodynamics in 1909. Further modifications were made for the expositions of 1900, 1925, and 1937. Additions made for television transmission added about 66 feet (20 meters) to the height.</p>
        <p>For many years the Eiffel Tower was in the hands of a public firm, but in 1981 the government of the city of Paris took over its management. In the years 1981 to 1983 the tower underwent extensive renovation and reconstruction in preparation for its 100th anniversary in 1989. The renovation, costing about 40 million dollars, stripped off the paint down to the girders, removed the excess weight of structures on the upper levels, and built new lighter-weight facilities for visitors.</p>
        <p>On the first level are three glass-enclosed structures. One is a museum, the Cinémax, which shows films about the tower. The central structure consists of two levels, each of which has a restaurant: Le Parisien on the lower and La Belle France on the upper. The third facility is the Salle (hall) Gustave Eiffel, which provides space for business conferences, expositions, cultural events, and social gatherings.</p>
        <p>On the smaller second level there is a souvenir shop and a snack bar. From this level it is possible to get an excellent view of Paris without the need to ascend to the top.</p>
        <p>Directions to the Eiffel Tower are below.</p>
