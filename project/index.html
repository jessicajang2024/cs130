    <p>Major cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia all offer unique traditions, languages and must-see sites!</p>

<p>Vibrant festivals such as La Fallas and La Tomatina draw huge crowds of both locals and tourists.</p>

<p>Spain is also known for producing the most olive oil in the world, as well as many fine wines. </p>

<p>Spain is famous for its glorious weather, and Madrid is favored in this regard. It’s the sunniest city in Europe, with almost 300 days of sunshine out of the year.</p> 

<p>Spain is famous for being a nation of friendly and easygoing people. Forget about rushing through life and take your time to enjoy all of life’s pleasures big and small – it’s what the Spaniards do.</p>

<p>Of course, modern life has changed the routines of many. The famous “siesta” where some Spanish farmers take an after lunch nap is slowly becoming less common. Don’t be fooled though – some stores and cafes are closed in the afternoon and early evening.

        <p class="margin-top-10"> 
            In addition to its famous museums, busy streets dotted with all kinds of shops, restaurants with world cuisine and unbeatable nightlife, Madrid will surprise you with its tranquil historic spots that charm everyone walking by.

        <p>Here you'll find traditional family-run, century-old bars where friends meet up for a drink, every style of neighbourhood and cultural centres that offer up an alternative type of tourism. 

        <p>Madrid's authenticity is hard to beat. It is welcoming and diverse. Madrid is, without a doubt, one of Europe’s most interesting cities.</p>

        <p>Walking around Madrid means coming across iconic spots such as the stunning Royal Palace, the Plaza Mayor with 400 years of history, the buzzing Puerta del Sol, the famous Gran Vía full of shops, or the four tallest towers in Spain. </p>

        <p>Each neighbourhood offers a different experience: La Latina is ideal for tapas, Las Letras has the perfect combination of literature and fine dining…</p> 

        <p>But Madrid also means relaxing in enormous green spaces such as the Retiro Park (which together with the Paseo del Prado boulevard have been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List), and other lesser-known but equally charming parks like El Capricho.

    <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>he Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is a museum of modern and contemporary art designed by Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, and located in Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain.</p>
        
    <p class="margin-top-10"> 
      The museum was inaugurated on 18 October 1997 by King Juan Carlos I of Spain, with an exhibition of 250 contemporary works of art. 

    <p>Built alongside the Nervion River, which runs through the city of Bilbao to the Cantabrian Sea, it is one of several museums belonging to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and features permanent and visiting exhibits of works by Spanish and international artists.

    <p>It is one of the largest museums in Spain. In 2020, the museum had 315,908 visitors, down 73 percent from 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

    <p>One of the most admired works of contemporary architecture, the building has been hailed as a "signal moment in the architectural culture", because it represents "one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were all completely united about something", according to architectural critic Paul Goldberger.</p>

    <p>The museum was the building most frequently named as one of the most important works completed since 1980 in the 2010 World Architecture Survey among architecture experts.</p>

    <p>Directions to Guggenheim Museum are below. </p>
