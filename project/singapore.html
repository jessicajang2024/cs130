        <p>While one gets to observe the cityâ€™s view from the deck from far above, they can also get a staggering view of the Gardens by the Bay, which is another iconic landmark of Singapore. </p>
        <p>Visiting the Marina Bay SkyPark early in the evening is an experience in itself. As a visitor, you will get to view either side of Singapore whether during daylight or after dark.</p>
        <p>Viewing the sunset from this point is just as mesmerising.</p>
        <p>There are guided tours available at the SkyPark, in case you have a love for understanding the knowhow of structural landmarks.</p>
        <p>These guided tours are insightful from knowing about the building to understanding the skyline view and the culturally rich heritage of Singapore.</p>
